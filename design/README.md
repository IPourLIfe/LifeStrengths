# LifeStrengths

[I Pour Life](http://www.ipourlife.org)

LifeStrengths is the name of the app because it emphasizes their curriculum and provides interactions between students (youth) and mentors (life coaches) taking part in the LifeStrengths program.  (Also, they already had a more general app for I Pour Life).

"Thriving" was a key phrase that the project stakeholder (Stephanie from I Pour Life) kept mentioning, in addition to themes of constant positivity, encouragement, and never giving up.

We tried to embody those themes in the design of the app with a feeling of warmth and sunlight combined with water (specifically the ocean or sea, as an example life map they gave was a youth setting a goal to go on a beach vacation and them helping them plan the tasks to achieve that goal) to tie into the theme encapsulated in their organization name, I Pour Life, of pouring love, time, commitment, and encouragement into the lives of the youth.

Additionally, we wanted to follow Material Design guidelines for a consistent UX that would also play well specifically with Android, as many of the youth are likely to use the app from an Android device.  The base sea green color used in the Material Design guidelines ended up matching our intended UX quite well, so we pivoted the accent colors to tangerine and tomato and voila, our color palette was defined.

We also intentionally borrowed layout inspiration from other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Snapchat, etc. to piggy back on familiarity from the youth already using those platforms.
