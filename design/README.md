# LifeStrengths

[I Pour Life](http://www.ipourlife.org)

LifeStrengths is the name of the app because it emphasizes their curriculum and providers interactions between students (youth) and mentors (life coaches) taking part in the LifeStrengths program.  (Also, they already had a more general app for I Pour Life).

"Thriving" was a key phrase that the project stakeholder (Stephanie from I Pour Life) kept mentioning, in addition to themes of constant positivity, encouragement, and never giving up.

We tried to embody those themes in the design of the app with a feeling of warmth and sunlight combined with water (specifically the ocean or sea) to tie into their organization name, I Pour Life, of pouring love, time, commitment, and encouragement into the lives of the youth.

Additionally, we wanted to follow Material Design guidelines for a consistent UX that would also play well specifically with Android, as many of the youth are likely to use the app from an Android device.  The base color used in the Material Design guidelines ended up matching our intended UX quite well, so we pivoted the accent colors to tangerine and tomato and voila.

We also intentionally borrowed layout inspiration from other social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Snapchat, etc. to piggy back on familiarity from the youth already using those platforms.
